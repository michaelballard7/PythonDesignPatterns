"""

    The strategy pattern offers a family of interchangeable algorithms to a client

    There maybe a need to dynamically change an object

    An abstract strategy class will have a default set of behaviors

    Concrete are used when there is a need to dynamically replace the default behavior

    Python allows adding methods dynamically via the types module

    The main goal of this pattern is to enable a client class to choose between different algorithms or procedures to complete the same task.
