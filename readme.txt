Design patterns represent best practices used by experienced object oriented developers

Design patterns create a common platform and terminology  for developers

There are 23 design patterns that can be classified in 3 categories: Creational, Strutural and Behavioral patterns


creational design patterns are design patterns that deal with object creation mechanisms, trying to create objects in a manner suitable to the situation. 

The basic form of object creation could result in design problems or in added complexity to the design. 

Creational design patterns solve this problem by somehow controlling this object creation.
